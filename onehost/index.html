    <h1>Lesson 1</h1>
    <h3>HTML definition</h3>
    <p>Hypertext (hyper links) markup language (makes the elements)<br>
      HTML is the document containing all the information for the website.<br>
      Provides the structure; plain text.<br>
      The head is the thinking behind the website, the setup information, telling the browser information about the website without displaying it.<br>
      Also contains the meta tags that contains the information read by the browser. Followed by the link tag, ie. to the stylesheet, and the title tag being the name of the website.<br>
      The body is the clothes; everything that is to be displayed on the website.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>CSS Definition</h3>
    <p>CSS makes the website look pretty. Provides visual enhancements to the plain text.<br>
      There are 3 ways to implement CSS styling:<br>  
      <span> INLINE STYLING:</span> Adding the style in the individual line of code. Best used for email (HTML) in one file. Something smaller and singular.<br>
      <Span>INTERNAL STYLE TAGS:</Span>
       Found in the head. Increase the information talking to the browser. Not for larger scale projects.<br>
      <span>EXTERNAL STYLESHEETS:</span>
       Separate file for styling in the same folder. Stylesheets are added in the head link tag. These are used most commonly, and are easier to handly with a multi file project.<br>
      <br>
      Style tags are made up of a selctor, property and value.<br>
      The selector selects which element a rule applies to; the property defines which aspect of an element is being controlled; the value defines the value a particular property will take according to the rule.<br>
